# Petition to the Government of Canada
Whereas:

* 	Immigration applicants of Express Entry - Federal Skilled Workers Outland Stream ( FSW - O) are experiencing severe discrimination and injustice by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) since 2020. Not only did IRCC fail to notify the applicants that the work of approving CoPR (Confirmation of Permanent Residence) to FSW-O stream was suspended due to covid-19. They have not even responded to applicants’ questions about the long delay. This dereliction of duty has kept thousands of applicants waiting for 18, 24 months or even longer in the FSW-O program that should have ended in 6 months;

* 	IRCC's treatment of FSW-O applicants is against humanity and human rights. We cannot make any long-term plan while waiting for CoPR. This lack of transparency and never-respond behavior of IRCC has caused a huge obstacle to the applicant's normal life. Applicants cannot sign long-term job contracts, cannot rent a house for a long time, cannot get pregnant and have children. Because all these action might make the endless wait even longer;

* 	The cruel discrimination committed by IRCC has greatly harmed the applicant’s mental health since the feeling of endless waiting results in a deep sense of anxiety and insecurity and also distrust in the Canada government;

* 	At the same time, IRCC keeps starting new programs, processing files from other streams, claiming fake political achievements to the media, ignoring the applicants of FSW-O who are well-educated and highly skilled professional workers around the world. IRCC's actions have led to the extreme disappointment of applicants, undermined the image of the Canadian government, and caused a certain number of applicants to choose other countries, which would make Canada fail in the competition to attract global talents;

* 	IRCC needs a federal ombudsman who would help improve quality and who would bring transparency to the services provided to applicants;

* 	Applicants have the right to be protected if they believe that one of their rights has not been respected and if they believe the IRCC made an error or committed an injustice;

We, the undersigned, the immigration applicants of Express Entry - Federal Skilled Workers Outland, call upon the Government of Canada to 1) follow the first-in-first-out principle, start processing and finalizing the FSW-0-applications from 2019 and 2020 which have already been delayed; 2) set an office of a federal ombudsman to receive complaints and address errors and injustices to applicants.
